# Assessment Project (SEITWrittenTest-2023)

For this assessment I'm using Katalon Studio Framework. Katalon uses Groovy as the engine for their scripts. As we know, Groovy is a language that extends the Java programming language in a form that is simpler and easier to understand. I created a file structure using several OOP concepts such as inheritance and recording objects using keywords
